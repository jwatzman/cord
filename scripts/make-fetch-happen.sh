# Make fetch happen:
# - updates `origin/master` from the central repository
# - rebases all your local branches on origin/master (or as close to it as
#   possible without conflicts)
# - runs `npm install` if necessary (i.e. if package-lock.json changed)
# - runs `scripts/generate-dotenv.cjs` if that script has changed or there is
#   no existing .env file
# - runs `npm run migrate` if necessary (i.e. if something in `database/`
#   changed)

# While this script runs, it might update your local Git checkout... would be
# weird if that changes the contents of the script (because it got updated on
# master) while it's running. We can protect against that by putting
# parentheses around it. Then bash has to read all of the script to parse it
# before it starts executing.

❌ Too bad: you don't have the `rephresh` tool installed.

On a Mac, go to `https://github.com/getcord/rephresh/releases` in your browser.
You must be signed into GitHub, because this is a private repository. Download
the `rephresh-mac.tar.gz` file of the latest release, then do:
# sudo tar vxzf rephresh-mac.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
# sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/rephresh
That should get you started!
